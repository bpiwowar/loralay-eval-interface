{"id": "PMC3309138", "output": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Although the current treatment of radiation therapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth, prognosis and improve the quality of patientsâ€™ life, metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur. Emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of small non-coding RNAs (snoRNAs) in mammary gland tumorigenesis, functioning as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. As small non-coding RNAs regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis, they may represent a novel cancer therapy."}

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study including adult patients clinically and functionally diagnosed with asthma and receiving outpatient treatment at the Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital, located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Patients were divided into two groups according to the clinical severity of asthma based on the Global Initiative for Asthma criteria: the mild asthma (MA) group, comprising patients with mild intermittent or persistent asthma; and the moderate or severe asthma (MSA) group, comprising patients using long-acting 2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids at low or moderate doses. Results: A total of 142 patients were studied. Of those, 72 (17 with mild intermittent asthma and 55 with mild persistent asthma) were allocated to the MA group and 70 (53 with mild intermittent asthma and 17 with moderate asthma) were allocated to the MSA group. Of the sample as a whole, 62 patients (43.7"}

The conformally invariant action includes a triplet of scalar fields and SO(3) non-Abelian gauge fields. However, the usual mass term μ^2 ϕ^2 is forbidden by the symmetry and this role is now played by the conformal coupling of the Ricci scalar to the scalar fields. Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs via gravitation. The spherically symmetric solutions correspond to localized solitons (magnetic monopoles) in asymptotically anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space-time and the metric outside the core of the monopole is found to be Schwarzschild-AdS. Though conformal symmetry excludes the Einstein-Hilbert term in the original action, it emerges in the effective action after spontaneous symmetry breaking and dominates the low-energy/long-distance regime outside the core of the monopole.

We demonstrate that the analytical theory is in a good qualitative (and in some aspects quantitative) agreement with the exact calculations. There are however some important discrepancies. In order to understand the origin of these discrepancies we investigate the self-consistent electronic structure and charge density distribution in the nanoribbons and relate the above discrepancy to the inability of the simple electrostatic model to capture the classical gate electrostatics of the GNRs. In turn, the failure of the classical electrostatics is traced to the quantum mechanical effects leading to the significant modification of the self-consistent charge distribution in comparison to the non-interacting electron description. The role of electron-electron interaction in the electronic structure and the capacitance of the GNRs is discussed. Our exact numerical calculations show that the density distribution and the potential profile in the GNRs are qualitatively different from those in conventional split-gate quantum wires; at the same time, the electron distribution and the potential profile in the GNRs show qualitatively similar features to those in the cleaved-edge overgrown quantum wires. Finally, we discuss an experimental extraction of the quantum capacitance from experimental data. "}
{"id": "0909.0592", "lang": "en", "abstract": "  Dynamical friction arises from the interaction of a perturber and the gravitational wake it excites in the ambient medium. This interaction is usually derived assuming that the perturber has a constant velocity. In realistic situations, motion is accelerated as for instance by dynamical friction itself. Here, we study the effect of acceleration on the dynamical friction force. We characterize the density enhancement associated with a constantly accelerating perturber with rectilinear motion in an infinite homogeneous gaseous medium and show that dynamical friction is not a local force and that its amplitude may depend on the perturber's initial velocity. The force on an accelerating perturber is maximal between Mach 1 and Mach 2, where it is smaller than the corresponding uniform motion friction. In the limit where the perturber's size is much smaller than the distance needed to change the Mach number by unity through acceleration, a subsonic perturber feels a force similar to uniform motion friction only if its past history does not include supersonic episodes. Once an accelerating perturber reaches large supersonic speeds, accelerated motion friction is marginally stronger than uniform motion friction. The force on a decelerating supersonic perturber is weaker than uniform motion friction as the velocity decreases to a few times the sound speed. Dynamical friction on a decelerating subsonic perturber with an initial Mach number larger than 2 is much larger than uniform motion friction and tends to a finite value as the velocity vanishes in contrast to uniform motion friction.

{"id": "1308.1740", "lang": "en", "abstract": "  The standard technique for measurement of random uncertainties of star formation histories (SFHs) is the bootstrap Monte Carlo, in which the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) is repeatedly resampled. The variation in SFHs measured from the resampled CMDs is assumed to represent the random uncertainty in the SFH measured from the original data. However, this technique systematically and significantly underestimates the uncertainties for times in which the measured star formation rate is low or zero, leading to overly (and incorrectly) high confidence in that measurement. This study proposes an alternative technique, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which samples the probability distribution of the parameters used in the original solution to directly estimate confidence intervals. While the most commonly used MCMC algorithms are incapable of adequately sampling a probability distribution that can involve thousands of highly correlated dimensions, the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm is shown to be extremely effective and efficient for this particular task. Several implementation details, such as the handling of implicit priors created by parameterization of the SFH, are discussed in detail. "}

{"id": "1407.1693", "lang": "en", "abstract": "  Among the most spectacular variable stars are the Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs), which can show three types of variability. The LBV phase of evolution is poorly understood, and the driving mechanisms for the variability are not known. The most common type of variability, the S Dor instability, occurs on timescales of tens of years. During an S Dor outburst, the visual magnitude of the star increases, while the bolometric magnitude stays approximately constant. In this work, we investigate pulsation as a possible trigger for the S Dor type outbursts. We calculate the pulsations of envelope models using a nonlinear hydrodynamics code including a time-dependent convection treatment. We initialize the pulsation in the hydrodynamic model based on linear non-adiabatic calculations. Pulsation properties for a full grid of models from 20 to 85 M_⊙ were calculated, and in this paper we focus on the few models that show either long-period pulsations or outburst-like behaviour, with photospheric radial velocities reaching 70-80 km/s. At the present time, our models cannot follow mass loss, so once the outburst event begins, our simulations are terminated. Our results show that pulsations alone are not able to drive enough surface expansion to eject the outer layers. However, the outbursts and long-period pulsations discussed here produce large variations in effective temperature and luminosity, which are expected to produce large variations in the radiatively driven mass-loss rates.

We consider formation flight of two or three satellites in low eccentricity near Earth orbits. With the help of weak ion thrusters it is possible to accomplish tandem flight. With ion thrusters it is also possible to mimic many kinds of mutual force laws between the satellites. We found that both a constant repulsive force or an attractive force that decreases with the distance are able to preserve the formation in which the eccentricities cause the actual relative motion and the weak thrusters keep the mean longitude difference small. Initial values are important for the formation flight but very exact adjustment of orbital elements is not important. Simplicity is one of our goals in this study and this result is achieved at least in the way that, when constant force thrusters are used, the satellites only need to detect the directions of the other ones to fly in tandem. A repulsive acceleration of the order of 10^-6 times the Earth attraction, is enough to effectively eliminate the disruptive effects of all the perturbations at least for a timescale of years. "}

We have checked that the transverse and longitudinal grid sizes in our simulation are large enough to handle cutoff effects under control. By comparing the numerical results from several initial conditions with different magnitudes of instability seed and also those with different wave-numbers for rapidity fluctuations, we clearly see that unstable modes dominantly grow up in the linear regime and we also confirm non-linear effects in the time evolution. To extract more detailed information on the evolving Glasma, we decompose the energy into the components in terms of rapidity wave-numbers. We observe an energy flow from low wave-number modes into higher wave-number modes due to non-linearity in the equations of motion. We find that the energy spectrum approaches an asymptotic scaling that is consistent with Kolmogorov's power-law form even in the expanding system of the Glasma. "}

Materials and Methods. Gene and protein expression of OPG, TRAIL, and OPG/TRAIL ratio were quantified in the aorta and the hearts of control mice, dyslipidemic mice, and diabetic mice. Results. Diabetes significantly increased OPG and the OPG/TRAIL ratio expression in the aorta, while dyslipidemia was the major determinant of the changes observed in the heart, where it significantly increased OPG and reduced TRAIL expression, thus increasing cardiac OPG/TRAIL ratio. Conclusions. This work shows that both dyslipidemia and diabetes affect OPG/TRAIL ratio in the cardiovascular system. This could contribute to the changes in circulating OPG/TRAIL which are observed in patients with diabetes and CVD. Most importantly, these changes could mediate/contribute to atherosclerosis development and cardiac remodeling."}

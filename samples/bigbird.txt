{"id": "0907.1040", "output": "The capacitance of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) embedded in an insulating substrate is investigated by means of analytical and numerical calculations. The analytical approach is based on the tight-binding p-orbital Hamiltonian within the Hartree approximation. The results of the analytical calculations are in a good qualitative agreement with the exact calculations. However, there are some important discrepancies. In order to resolve these discrepancies we investigate the self-consistent electronic structure and charge density distribution in the nanoribbons and relate the above discrepancy to the inability of the simple electrostatic model to capture the classical gate electrostatics of the GNRs. In turn, the failure of the classical electrostatics is traced to the quantum mechanical effects leading to the significant modification of the self-consistent charge distribution in comparison to the non-interacting electron description.\n"}
{"id": "0909.0592", "output": "We derive a new expression of dynamical friction that applies to a general type of motion and depends on the perturber's motion and the boundary conditions but not the density perturbation. In particular, dynamical friction is shown to be non-local as it depends on the whole trajectory of the perturber. In effect a constant velocity perturber raises a gravitational wake in the ambient medium that is symmetric with respect to it and truncated by the sonic shockwave. This truncation defines two regions, one that lacks front-back symmetry located behind the perturber, and one with front-back symmetry around the perturber that becomes the largest region inside the wavefront for velocities smaller than half the sound speed. When acceleration is taken into account, the amplitude of dynamical friction may change with respect to the value derived assuming a constant velocity because in modelling the force on an accelerated perturber as that on a constant velocity perturber, one assumes that the gravitational wake produced by accelerated motion is similar to that of uniform motion. This would intuitively imply that dynamical friction on an accelerated perturber should be much larger than the value derived assuming uniform motion for subsonic accelerating perturbers.\n"}
{"id": "1303.7474", "output": "A general framework for independent vector analysis (IVA) is presented. IVA is an extension of the independent component analysis (ICA) model. IVA assumes a source within one dataset is dependent on at most one source in another dataset while sources within a dataset are mutually independent (as in ICA). IVA reduces to performing ICA individually on each dataset when sources possess no dependence across datasets. Naturally, IVA can be achieved by maximizing the likelihood function, which is shown to be the same in practice as minimizing the entropy rate (subject to a regularity term). The likelihood function has an associated Fisher information matrix (FIM) of a form that we describe in Section VI. The FIM is used in deriving the identification conditions and performance bounds. The IVA case when samples are iid is shown to have a performance bound that can be expressed compactly for the very large class of multivariate elliptical distributions. The performance bounds are compared to the performance achieved by two previously published algorithms for IVA.\n"}

While significant work has been dedicated to the derivation and implementation of SFH measurement techniques, estimation of uncertainties in SFH measurements has been given considerably less attention. On the topic of systematic uncertainties due to isochrone physics, Dolphin (2012) proposed a technique for estimating the size of these uncertainties. However, an unstanding of random uncertainties is equally critical, especially when analyzing less-populated CMDs where random uncertainties are likely to dominate.

The rational behind this is that  couples very weakly to gravitational radiation while it is affected by the same instrumental noises as the other combinations. These approximations give a lower bound on the error that can be achieved by estimators which make no prior assumptions about the characteristics of the various noise sources.\n"}

Steroids are still the mainstay of treatment, usually used at high doses initially to get the disease under control and then in conjunction with a steroid-sparing agent for maintenance. Because of the side effects associated with long-term systemic corticosteroids such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and ocular complications, a lot of the recent research in pemphigus has been directed at finding the optimal steroid-sparing agent. Though many treatments have been tried in the management of pemphigus, often demonstrating clinical benefit in individual case reports and case series, the evidence supporting their use has not been confirmed in randomized controlled trials. This is due to the rarity of the disease in most countries where RCTs have been performed and difficulty in recruiting patients, resulting in underpowered studies.

The problem with images of the brain acquired in vivo with MRI and DTI is that they are limited in both resolution and contrast. The data needs to be averaged across many subjects who represent broad demographic or clinical groups in order to extract significant measures. In practice, it is not possible with MRI to localize the exact borders of neighboring neuroanatomical structures and identify the underlying histological features on which radiologic images depend. The challenges in creating a comprehensive histological model of the human brain that matches the scope and usability of MRI population-based templates, including the proposed Connectome, are primarily logistical. To begin with, any study that aims at examining cellular-level features in a brain depends on the expiration of the subject, and consequently neuroanatomical studies have been confined to those few cases where autopsies were prescribed because of clinical or legal concerns or to individuals who enrolled in tissue donation programs.

We demonstrate that the analytical theory is in a good qualitative (and in some aspects quantative) agreement with the exact numerical calculations based on the tight-binding p-orbital Hamiltonian within the Hartree approximation. In order to clarify the origin of the discrepancies we investigate the self-consistent electronic structure and charge distribution in the GNRs and relate the above discrepancy to the inability of the simple electrostatic model to capture the classical gate electrostatics of the GNRs. In turn, the failure of the classical electrostatics is traced to the quantum mechanical effects leading to the significant modification of the self-consistent charge distribution in comparison to the non-interacting electron description.\n"}
{"id": "0909.0592", "output": "Dynamical friction is the reaction force that a perturber feels from the gravitational wake it generates in the ambient medium. Following the pioneering work of Chandrasekhar (1943) on the gravitational drag experienced by a perturber in collisionless star systems, the derivations of dynamical friction assume that the perturber has a constant velocity in the ambient medium. Neglecting the perturber's accelerated motion is justified by the small amplitude of the force that is proportional to the square of the pertuber's mass. Neglecting acceleration is mainly motivated by the lack of an analytical framework where the perturber's accelerated motion could be taken into account. To overcome this obstacle, we derive in Appendix A a new expression of dynamical friction that applies to a general type of motion and depends on the perturber's motion and the boundary conditions but not the density perturbation. In particular, dynamical friction is shown to be non-local as it depends on the whole trajectory of the perturber. Although non-locality does not appear if the perturber's velocity is constant, its origin is easy to identify: as the perturber's wake propagates in the medium, a velocity change because of acceleration affects the density enhancement near the\n"}

{"id": "1401.2564", "output": "The gravitino in models with bilinear R-parity violation is an attractive dark matter (DM) candidate since this type of models provides a possibility to reconcile the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the Universe via thermal leptogenesis with the constraints on late-decaying particles from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). The high reheating temperature required for thermal leptogenesis naturally leads to a thermally produced gravitino relic abundance that matches the observed DM density in the Universe if the gravitino mass is in the range of roughly ten to several hundreds of GeV. Interestingly, the cosmological constraints on the size of R-parity violation allow for a gravitino lifetime that can be probed by cosmic-ray experiments, i.e. the decay of gravitino DM in the Galactic halo can lead to observable signals in the spectra of cosmic rays. We report on lower limits on the gravitino lifetime and the corresponding upper limits on the amount of R-parity violation that were derived from observations of cosmic-ray antiprotons with the PAMELA experiment. We also compare the obtained lifetime limits to constraints derived from gamma-ray and neutrino observations.\n"}

Early studies of the data analysis techniques that will be required to observe these signals are important since they couple our present knowledge about the sources LISA will be able to observe to the science requirements guiding the design of the LISA mission itself. We present here a study of the accuracy that can be expected for the characterization of the noise in the LISA detector once it has been placed in its heliocentric orbit. Specifically, we calculate in the low frequency regime the optimal approximations for the spectra of the noise affecting the interferometric combinations sensitive to gravitational waves, by relying only on all the possible cross-spectra between the interferometric combinations that are sensitive to gravitational radiation and the symmetrized-Sagnac combination,. The rational behind this is that  couples very weakly to gravitational radiation while it is affected by the same instrumental noises\n"}

{"id": "PMC3334523", "output": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are the most widely utilized methods for mapping brain circuitry at the system level, and thus also the primary tools of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). These non-invasive neuroimaging modalities are often combined with DTI to show major fiber tracts in the deep white matter. The problem with images of the brain acquired in vivo with MRI and DTI is that they are limited in both resolution and contrast. The data needs to be averaged across many subjects who represent broad demographic or clinical groups in order to extract significant measures. In practice, it is not possible with MRI to localize the exact borders of neighboring neuroanatomical structures and identify the underlying histological features on which radiologic images depend. The latter can only be determined postmortem. A better understanding of local white matter architecture at the microscopic level can help defining DTI acquisition and modeling parameters; these may need to be specific to different regions of the brain, just like MRI. Furthermore, the correspondence between images acquired in vivo and those from histopathology is enormously improved if the latter cover the whole brain, just like MRI.
